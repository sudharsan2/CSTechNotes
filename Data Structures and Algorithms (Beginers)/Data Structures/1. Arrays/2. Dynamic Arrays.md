1. Dynamic arrays are static arrays but without a definite size.

2. how to dynamic array works is each programming language has a default size for an array for ex. (java has its default size as 10)

3. when we have to add an element after the array exceeds its current size. it will create a new array with double the size of the previous array and we can start adding the element to the array.

4. the reason for the doubling in the size instead of adding a space to fit in a single element is because whenever a new array is created to store the extra element all the elements from the previous array will be shifted to the new array and then only the new element can be added (old array is deleted) and moving like that takes O(n) time for the operations to avoid that, just for the safety purpose the sweet spot has been chosen as double the size of the previous array.  ![[Pasted image 20240615140538.png]]

5. we cant just setup an array with a huge size if we do that way we'll end up utilizing so much space from our RAM.

6. even thought the time complexity of moving the elements to the new array is O(n) the frequency of the occurrence when we are going to face the issue of running out of space is negligible and this is called amortized complexity and it is achieved by increasing the size of the new array by doubling the size.

7. there is a mathematical proof for this amortized complexity ![[Pasted image 20240615142049.png]] so the reason behind this is (with this example) the operations needed to add every 8 elements into a dynamic array is 15 which will be always less than the size of the next array which is 16 so 15 < ($2*8$) => 15 < ($2*n$) while  calculating time complexity we'll be ignoring the constants and thus our time complexity with the dynamic array is roughly $O(n)$

9. why do we not consider a constant while writing out time complexity?
	![[Screenshot 2024-06-15 at 2.30.40 PM.png]]
	it is because we can see from this graph that both $O(n)$ and $O(2*n)$ are intersecting at the graph line of the time complexity $O(n^2)$ and after that intersection the line of $n^2$ grows exponential and thats why when we are talking about huge numbers constants in time complexity are ignored.
