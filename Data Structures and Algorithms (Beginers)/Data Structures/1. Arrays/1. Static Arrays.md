1. for static arrays the time complexity of search is always O(1)

2. when you initialize a static array you can't add a new element later on after the array gets filled cause the next space may be filled with other value and the array breaks (this is its bigggest limitation)  and that is why dynamic arrays have been introduced [[2. Dynamic Arrays]] ![[Screenshot 2024-06-14 at 3.05.21 PM 1.png]]

3. not only searching also adding (at end) and removing an element from an array has an time complexity of O(1)

4. when we perform an insertion operation on a array the elements at the index and after the index needs shifting thus the worst case time complexity for insertion is O(n)![[Pasted image 20240614151147.png]] ==(same for removing in the middle)==

(ex prog. [[Static arrays (Python)]])
