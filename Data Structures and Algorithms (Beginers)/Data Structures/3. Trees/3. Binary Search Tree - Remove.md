1. Before actually removing a node from a BST we have to find the minimum value Node why so ? we will look in point no 4., so to find the the minimum value node we should traverse to the left of the BST until the current Node's left is Null
		pseudo code for this will look like this

	as we can see that this is like actually traversing a Linked List ([[Singly Linked Lists (Python)]])
	
2.  so when actually come to removing a node it basically has 2 cases
		Case 1: 0 or 1 child
		Case 2: 2 children

3. so for the first case (0 or 1 child) what we do is we iterate through the Nodes starting from the root until the value matches with the current Node's value and then check either left or right of the current node is null if it is then we return the other side of that Node to the previous Node. if both the sides are pointing to Null then we can return any of the sides (similar to [[1. Singly Linked Lists]]with a check condition of which side is not null).

4. for the second case (2 children) what we do is find the minValue node from the right subtree and then replace the node which we wanted to remove with the minimum value node from the right subtree (which will always be a leaf node). or we can go with finding the maxValue  Node from the left subtree and then replace it with the node we wanted to remove.

in the above example if we want to remove the Node 4 which has 2 children what we do is find the minValue Node from the right side which in this case is Node 5 and replace that with the Node 4 and the result would be a perfect BST (meaning that every element on the right will be greater than that Node and obviously left side will be smaller than the replaced Node because we are picking it from the right side) .

5. the pseudo code for removal will look like this
 ![[Pasted image 20240708130606.png]]
 here when we remove 4 from the above example BST it will come he else condition where both root.left and root.right are not null hence we search for minVal Node in root.right and assign that minValue Node's value to the root's value and then remove that minValue Node from the BST

6. so in the above example it is the worst case as we are removing the root Node of the entire BST so we search for the minValue Node which will be a leaf Node so for that the time complexity will be `O(log(n))` and then to remove that Node we must again traverse to the leaf Node which would again be `O(log(n))` so the overall time complexity will be `O(2*(log(n)))`  where 2 is constant so the time complexity is `O(log(n))`.
