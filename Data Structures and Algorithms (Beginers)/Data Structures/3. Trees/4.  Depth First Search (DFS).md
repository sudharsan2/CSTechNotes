1. so basically Depth first is traversing the entire Tree from Root Node to the Bottom , so the way we do it in DFS is first we traverse through the left subtree and then we go up to the root and then we traverse through the right subtree.
   if we store the value of each node of the tree by traversing like this this will result in a sorted array.

2. pseudo would look like this:
 ![[Pasted image 20240708160128.png]]
   so in the above code we can see that first the recursion function is called to the left until it reaches the leaf node and then we print the current node's val and then we recursively call the function on the right.

example problem:
[[Depth First Search (python)]]
