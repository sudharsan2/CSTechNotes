1. To insert a value in a BST we must start from the root Node and we must traverse through the tree by checking whether our insert value is greater than or less than our current node like we do in [[1. Binary Trees and Binary Search Trees]]

in the above example we need to insert 5 into the existing BST so we check 5 with 4 as it is greater than 4 we traverse right of the tree and then we check with 6 and 5 is smaller than 6 so we insert 5 to left of 6.

2. The above example of the insertion is just a simple method to insert a value into a BST but the preferred way would look like this ![[Pasted image 20240708093938.png]]
as we can see that this BST after insertion of 5 looks more balanced so there are couple Data Structures to implement this like AVL Trees which we will be looking upon in advanced DSA concepts.

3. pseudo code for the insertion would look like this

here we can see that it is similar to the search in a BST [[Binary Search Tree (Python)]]so for insertion also we are elimination the half of the options by checking whether the value to inserted is greater or lesser than the current node's value and hence the time complexity would be similar to the search which is `O(log(n))`
