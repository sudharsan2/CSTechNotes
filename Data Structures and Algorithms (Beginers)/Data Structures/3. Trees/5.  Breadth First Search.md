1. This can be applied to any binary tree (not only binary search tree) here we will search layer by layer it is kinda opposite to [[4.  Depth First Search (DFS)]] here we will search all the nodes in the same layer and then move to the next layer.

2. so here we have to use a data structure ([[3. Queues]]) to process all the children nodes in the same layer before moving to the next layer. we use Queues because we need to process in the order of **first in first out (FIFO)**.

3. pseudo code for BFS would look like this:

the important thing to note here is in the for loop `len(queue)` will not increase when the `queue.poploeft()` and `queue.append()` is performed inside the loop.

4. coming to the time complexity by looking at the code don't let the nested loop fool you here we can simply say the time complexity by looking at the nodes we travel in the tree

![[Pasted image 20240720083618.png]]
as we can see that we are just traveling to every node of the tree that's it so the time complexity is `O(n)`.
