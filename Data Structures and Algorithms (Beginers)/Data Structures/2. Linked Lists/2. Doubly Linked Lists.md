1. doubly linked lists is nothing but a singly linked list with previous pointer so that we can iterate in a reverse order.

2. previously with singly linked list if we need to delete or insert an element at the end first we need to iterate through the entire linked list and then delete the element or insert it  but now with an doubly linked list the time complexity is always going to be `O(1)`. 

ex code for deletion at the end:
```
node2 = tail.prev
node2.next = null
tail = node2
```
 
3. which satisfies the criteria to be an stack but it is less common for doubly linked list to be used as an stack over  arrays because  we still need to iterate through the list to find the index unlike arrays and thus arrays has an extra advantage to be used as an stack instead of using doubly linked lists.

4. to sum it up the time complexity comparison between arrays and linked lists:

here we have a caveat as i mentioned early even thought the insertion or deletion in the middle of the linked list is gonna take `O(1)` in most case we gonna need to iterate through the linked list till we reach the index and then perform the deletion operation which is gonna take `O(n)`.
