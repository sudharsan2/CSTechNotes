1. queue is a type of data structure that follows *FIFO* operation (First in First out) hence the time complexity for insertion at the the end (enqueue) and deletion from the start (Dequeue) must have time complexity of `O(1)`

2. and this cannot be done with arrays as deletion (except at the end) requires shifting the elements which is an O(n) opeation and thus implementing queue with linked list is the most efficient way. where we can set the 
```
	head = head.next
```
 and similarly for insertion at the end  simply we can do 

```
tail.next = ListNode4
tail = ListNode4
```
