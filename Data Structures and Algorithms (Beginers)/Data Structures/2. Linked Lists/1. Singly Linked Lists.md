1. so basically linked list is an object with 2 parts 1st is the actual value and the 2nd one is contains the address (i like to call it as reference ) of the next element

2. as you can see from the image above the elements are stored in a different order in the ram  rather than we actually connect them and this shows that unlike arrays linked lists need not be next to each other in the RAM which is a huge advantages because now we don't have to worry about the continuously space availability in the RAM we can allocate space for an elements in linked list anywhere and still we can have the elements in a group *(similar to an array)*.

3. if our current node's next i.e. `cur.next` is point to a null the we can conclude that we have reached the end of our linked list and if nothing points to our node than that's our starting node

	we can iterate through our linked list like this:

```
cur = ListNode1
while (cur!= null):
	cur = cur.next
```

4. to add a new element to the end of the linked list:

```
tail.next = ListNode4
tail = ListNode4
```

5. to remove an element from somewhere  middle in the linked list we need to point the previous Node's next to next Node of the current

		to explain with code:

```
head.next = head.next.next
```

6. unlike the arrays we are not shifting every elements after the element to the left until the end of the list (explain in static arrays point no. 4) [[1. Static Arrays]] 

	so here we are just point the reference (next) to the next node of the node we need to remove thus the time complexity is `O(1)` here.
	same goes for inserting an element in the middle. we dont have to worry about deleting the element we have remove from the linked list as most of the programming language has garbage collection it will take care of deleting the unused variable from the RAM.

7. but practically to search an element in a linked list is done by starting at the head of an linked list and traversing until the index is found because unlike arrays linked lists are not stored in the grouped thus can't be found using index it must be done like the shown in the example program.

(example program - [[Singly Linked Lists (Python)]])
