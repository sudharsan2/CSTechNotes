1. Binary trees are similar to linked list [[1. Singly Linked Lists]] but we represent it in side ways like this  ![[Screenshot 2024-07-07 at 4.41.35 PM.png]]
so in linked list each node will be pointing to only a single node but here each node will be pointing to 2 different node. 

2. The Node which is not pointed by any other node is called a `Root Node` (i.e the top not from the above image it is 2) and the node it is pointing to are its `child Nodes` , if 2  nodes have a same parent node then those 2 nodes are `Sibling Nodes`, if a node is not pointing to any other node then it is called `Leaf Node`

3. The binary tree can be cyclic meant that it cannot be pointing to the parent node or a sibling node.

4. To calculate the height of the tree or a subtree we start from that node and follow until the descendent node is reached so in the above example the height of the tree starting from the root node would be 2. 

5. Depth is opposite to height we start form a node and follow up the tree until the particular ancestor node is reached.

   7.  ==Binary Search Trees are similar to Binary trees but in this the left child will be always smaller in value than its parent node and the right child will be always greater than the parent node.==

8. the time complexity to find a target (shown in below example problem) in a binary search tree would be `O(log(n))` but for this to work the BST should always be roughly balanced meaning the height should equal on both the sides other wise the time complexity would be different as we are not eliminating half of the possibilities so in worst case the time complexity would be `O(n)`,

9. so the time complexity of binary search in sorted array is also `O(log(n))` and still why do we have the complicated data structure like binary search tree is because to insert or remove an element from middle would `O(n)` in an array but in BST it would be `O(log(n))`.
